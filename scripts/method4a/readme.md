dR = growR\*R + intrRS\*R\*S + intrRT\*R\*T

dS = growS\*S + intrRS\*S\*R + intrRT\*S\*T

dT = intrTV\*T\*(R+S)

1. Fits clone growth rates using the nude mice pure experiments
2. Fits clone interaction using average of clone growth rates and nude mice admix experiments
3. Fits t-cell interaction (single term for both subclones) using B6 mice

Does multiple runs per experiment
