dR = growR\*R + intrRS\*R\*S

dS = growS\*S + intrRS\*S\*R

Fits the same model for nude and b6 mice:
1. Fits clone growth rates using the nude/b6 mice pure experiments (separately)
2. Fits clone interaction using average of clone growth rates and nude/b6 mice admix experiments (separately)

Does multiple runs per experiment

Note: currently changed to use medians instead of averages, saving to 5b
